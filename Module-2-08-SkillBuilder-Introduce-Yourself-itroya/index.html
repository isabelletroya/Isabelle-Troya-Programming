    <h2>Autobiography</h2>
  
      <p>I was born and raised in Tampa, Florida. I am both Cuban and Puerto Rican. I am currently 19 years old pursuing a Bachelor's degree in computer science while attending the Univeristy of South Florida as a first generation student. I hope to become a software developer once I graduate in 2024.

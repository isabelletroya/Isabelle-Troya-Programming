# Isabelle-Troya-Programming
This past summer I completed the 2021 Global Tech Program as a student from the University of South Florida. 
This program focused on Web Development allowing me to learn about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and APIs. 
This repository contains all the projects I have completed.

Links 1-6 primarily focus on HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
Links 7-12 primarily focus on JavaScript and APIs
